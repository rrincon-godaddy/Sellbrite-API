Each channel varies on the carrier name that they accept.  Below is a list of preferred shipping carrier names that you can provide when creating a shipment in Sellbrite.  If an unknown carrier name is provided, e.g. "Joe's Trucking Service", Sellbrite will follow the channel specific rules for sending tracking numbers and attempt to cast this to the correct default "Other" type if required.
